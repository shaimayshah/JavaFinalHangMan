## Java the Hut's Final Java Project 

Welcome to Java the Hut's final project repository. Over here, you can find our 1- or 2- player hangman game. 
Since this is for an object oriented programming class, we decided to use a lot of inheritance and polymorphism to show how we understand the core concepts. 
To play the game, download the repository and open it in your terminal. Then, move into the "Final JAR" folder type in "java -jar Untitled.jar".
That should work!

We hope you have fun!
